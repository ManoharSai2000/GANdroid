As a matter of fact, they have improved the security against malware attacks reasonably. But are they perfect?\n* This work shows that the black box anti-virus softwares are not reliable and can be broken down by using the same Machine Learning techniques.\n* This methodology involves training a General Adversial Network to produce malware samples that convinces the Black Box Detectors that they are benign.\n* There are some similar works done in this area, and this work is an extension of them. But most importantly, this method is used to produce malware samples that could be injected into android apps, and make them appear benign. As most of the malware is now being shared and replicated through apps, this is consdered to be severely important."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Related Work\n* https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05983\n* https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8424635"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport tensorflow as tf","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Dataset and Features"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* The dataset is owned by Google which is used to detect malware and benign samples, given a set of apps and its features like permissions taken and API calls.\n* The data is in the form of one hot vectors with different permissions and API calls.
