Bypass Machine Learning Security with Machine Learning

## Framework
**Tensorflow/Keras**

## Introduction
Generative Adeversial Networks are well known for Image generation, domain translation and dataset generation. This work is inspired from the **Generating Adversarial Malware Examples for Black-Box Attacks Based on GAN - https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05983**. We can bypass the Antivirus softwares when even we dont know what their working is(blackbox).

This specific version bypasses the Android Playstore security which enables the hackers to install harmful apps to our mobiles. This motivates us to build more robust antimalware packages.

## Dataset
The dataset is unique and the information and download link can be found here.

## Metrics
**TPR** The percentage of samples, the black box software correctly identifies. (Should be low in our case).

## Results
TPR ~ 20%
